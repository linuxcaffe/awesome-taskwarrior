CONFIGURATION VARIABLE SUBSTITUTION

Taskwarrior configuration values may reference other configuration variables using the syntax:

${variable}


At configuration read time, referenced variables are expanded to their current values.

Example
priority.span=3
priority.need.span=${priority.span}


is equivalent to:

priority.need.span=3


after configuration processing.

Scope and Resolution

Substitution applies to all configuration files, including those loaded via include and rc: overrides.

Referenced variables may be defined in:

the primary configuration file (~/.taskrc)

any included configuration file

command-line rc: overrides

Expansion occurs after all configuration files are read and before values are used.

Undefined Variables

If a referenced variable is undefined, it expands to an empty string.

Example:

foo=${bar}


results in:

foo=

Characteristics

Substitution is not recursive beyond the referenced value.

Substitution is not shell expansion and does not evaluate commands.

Expansion is purely textual and occurs once per configuration read.

Use Cases

Variable substitution allows centralization of commonly used values:

priority.span=5
priority.need.span=${priority.span}
priority.want.span=${priority.span}


Changing priority.span updates all dependent configuration values.

Limitations

Substitution does not provide conditional logic.

Substitution does not persist expanded values; only the reference is stored.
