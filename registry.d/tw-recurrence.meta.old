long_desc=Comprehensive recurrence enhancement for Taskwarrior supporting both
  'chained' recurrence (completion-based spawning) and 'periodic' recurrence
  (time-based spawning). Features include instance pile-up control, relative
  date calculations, template-instance relationship management, and sophisticated
  recurrence pattern handling that extends beyond Taskwarrior's native
  capabilities. Designed for power users who need fine-grained control over
  recurring task behavior.
