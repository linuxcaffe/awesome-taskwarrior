works great! (app info needs tweaking, but I'll do that.
Now riddle me this; when I'm working on one of the apps, outside of this wonderful context window, how should I ask future Claude to make the app conform to these requirements and templates?

Great question! Here's how to get the best results from future Claude sessions:
📋 The Perfect Prompt Template

I'm working on a Taskwarrior extension called [APP_NAME] that needs to integrate 
with the awesome-taskwarrior ecosystem.

Project Context:
- Target: Taskwarrior 2.6.2 (NOT 3.x)
- Type: [hook/wrapper/utility]
- Current repo: [YOUR_REPO_URL]

Reference Files:
I've attached/uploaded:
- The project knowledge base (includes DEVELOPERS.md, API.md, templates)
- My current [hook/wrapper] code
- [any other relevant files]

What I Need:
[Be specific: create .meta file / update installer / fix bug / add feature]

Requirements:
- Follow awesome-taskwarrior conventions
- Use lib/tw-common.sh functions (for bash)
- Use lib/tw-wrapper.py (for Python wrappers)
- Include proper error handling
- Support --dry-run in installers

Please review the templates in dev/models/ and create/update the files following 
those patterns.

🎯 Specific Scenarios
Creating a new app:

I want to add [APP_NAME] to awesome-taskwarrior.

It's a [hook/wrapper] that [brief description].

Please create:
1. registry.d/[app-name].meta
2. installers/[app-name].install

Following the templates in dev/models/ and using the actual repo at [URL].

Updating an existing installer:

The tw-recurrence installer needs to [describe change].

Current installer is attached. Please update it following the template 
in dev/models/hook-template.install and using tw-common.sh library functions.

Debugging installation issues:

tw --install [app-name] is failing with: [error message]

Attached:
- installers/[app-name].install
- Debug output from tw --debug --install [app-name]

The installer should use tw-common.sh functions. What's wrong?

💡 Pro Tips

1. Always mention the project knowledge:

This project has comprehensive documentation in the knowledge base including 
DEVELOPERS.md and API.md. Please reference those for conventions.

2. Be specific about which template to use:

Use dev/models/hook-template.install as the starting point, not a generic bash script.

3. Request incremental changes:

Don't rewrite the whole file - just show me the changes needed for [specific feature].

4. Ask for explanations:

Explain how this follows the awesome-taskwarrior patterns before generating code.

📦 What to Include

Always helpful:

    Link to DEVELOPERS.md: "Follow the architecture in DEVELOPERS.md"
    Link to API.md: "Use functions documented in dev/API.md"
    Mention templates: "Match the style in dev/models/"

For installers:

    "Use tw-common.sh library functions (see dev/API.md)"
    "Follow hook-template.install or wrapper-template.install"
    "Include install(), uninstall(), and test() functions"

For .meta files:

    "Follow the format in dev/models/[hook/wrapper]-template.meta"
    "All required fields must be present"
    "Tags should match existing taxonomy"

🔄 The Magic Phrase

End with:

Before generating, confirm you understand the awesome-taskwarrior conventions 
and which template applies.

This makes Claude review the docs first!
📝 Example Full Prompt

I'm adding my tw-nicedates wrapper to awesome-taskwarrior.

Project knowledge contains:
- DEVELOPERS.md (architecture)
- dev/API.md (function reference)  
- dev/models/wrapper-template.meta and .install (templates)

Current repo: https://github.com/linuxcaffe/tw-nicedates-hook
The wrapper is nicedates.py and requires python3-dateutil.

Please create:
1. registry.d/nicedates.meta
2. installers/nicedates.install

Following wrapper-template patterns and using tw-common.sh functions.
The installer should install to ~/bin and handle the dateutil dependency.

Confirm you've reviewed the templates before generating.
